## 🛠️ Integrated Panel Interplay (The "Why")

- **Why check Calendar first?** To set the *context* for the day's tasks.
- **Why link ELFA to Smart Money?** To verify if narrative *sentiment* matches on-chain *reality*.
- **Why link Poker to Risk?** Because mental state (tilt) affects capital allocation decisions.
- **Why use Agents for deep dives?** To free up human bandwidth for *strategy* instead of *data gathering*.

---

**Summary**: Your daily workflow isn't just checking apps; it's navigating a **unified decision engine** where time, capital, and intelligence are synchronized.
