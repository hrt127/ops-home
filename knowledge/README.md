2. **Integration Point** - Connects Dojo knowledge to Ops-Home panels
3. **Pattern Library** - Documented workflows and best practices
4. **Example Repository** - Real-world usage examples

## Integration with Ops-Home

- **Ideas Panel** - Follows patterns from `patterns/ideas/`
- **Learning Lab** - References guides from `guides/learning/`
- **Project Manager** - Uses project templates from `templates/projects/`

## Quick Start

1. Browse `templates/` for ready-to-use structures
2. Read `guides/` for step-by-step workflows
3. Study `patterns/` for best practices
4. Review `examples/` for real implementations
